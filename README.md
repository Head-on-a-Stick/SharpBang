SharpBang (â™¯!) is a live ISO image that can be used to install a pre-configured Openbox/Tint2 desktop running on Debian stable.

The live-build system is used to create the ISO, just like the official Debian images. A full suite of rescue & recovery tools are included in the live environment and a rescue mode is accessible from the boot menu which can be used to open a shell in an installed system.

Documentation: https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/

### Build Instructions

Change into the **buster** directory then run:
```
lb clean --purge
lb config
lb build
```
Use `cp` to transfer the image to a USB stick:
```
cp sharpbang-buster.img /dev/sdX ; sync
```
The username for the live system is *user* and the password is *live*.

### Customising the Image

See the live-build documentation for detailed instructions.

#### auto/config

This contains the general configuration options for creating the image.

#### config/bootloaders

GRUB is used for UEFI systems and isolinux is for non-UEFI systems. Both use config/bootloaders/isolinux/splash.png as the background image.

#### config/packages.chroot

Contains .debs for any custom packages, the *sharp-configs* package provides the desktop configuration files & scripts and can be obtained from here:

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:Head_on_a_Stick:sharpbang/sharp-configs

The source can be downloaded from the repository then modified and rebuilt with `debuild -us -uc`.
