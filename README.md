## SharpBang

SharpBang (â™¯!) is a live ISO image that can be used to install a pre-configured Openbox/Tint2 desktop running on Debian stable.

The live-build system is used, just like the official Debian images. A full suite of rescue & recoery tools are included in the live environment and a rescue mode is accesible from the boot menu which can be used to open a shell in an installed system.
